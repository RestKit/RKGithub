# RestKit GitHub Example

This iOS example application demonstrates the new UI features of the development branch of the RestKit library.  Using RestKit's powerful object mapping engine, RKTableController and its related components are able to transform local objects into UITableViewCell representations allowing for an extremely clean and DRY UITableViewController.

## Building the Example App

To build this example app, simply clone it, `git submodule update --init`, and open the `RKGithub.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
